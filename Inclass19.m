%In class 19

% Problem 1. Imagine a clincal trial for two drugs that are intended to lower
% cholesterol. Assume 30 subjects are randomly divided into 3 groups that
% either receive a placebo or one of the two treatments. The mean initials
% levels of total cholesterol in each group are the same. The final
% measurements look like

placebo = [   194   183   199   189   189   214   212   186   191   190];
treatment1 = [    138   217   188   126   249   217   255   196   279   123];
treatment2 =[   152   152   151   143   161   142   142   141   161   135];

%A. Make a bar plot of the means of each group with errorbars (Hint, use
%bar and then use 'hold on' and then errorbar). 
%B. Run a one way ANOVA analysis to see whether any of the treatment groups showed
%a statistically signficant difference. 
%C. use the multcompare function to look at all pairs of samples and
%indicate which are significantly different. 

%Problem 2. In this directory, you will find a .mat file with three
%variables, xdat, ydat, and ydat2. For each pair (xdat, ydat) and (xdat,
%ydat2), fit the data to a first, second and third order polynomial. Which
%one is the best fit in each case? In at least one of the cases, do the
%problem with both the polyfit/polyval functions and with the 'fit' function.
